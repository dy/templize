* [ ] name
  ? what would be the name, sustainable for at least 10-15 years?
  ? what would be the name if no npm limitations?
  ? what would be the name radical, meaningful, short... reflecting spirit: tiny, fast, right?
  ? matches spectjs style: common sense abbreviation, not too fancy
  ? what would be the right name
  * template-parts.js
    - confusable with github
    - no personality
    - no much point over github
    - boring
    - requires polyfill
  * tempeh.js
    + funny
    + easy to remember
    + vegan
    - too fancy
    - doesn't reflect meaning
    + dom-parts/template-instance isn't stabilized
    + can apply to any node, not just template; or allows `<template immediate>`
  * templ-in.js? templin.js? in-templ.js?
    + temple-in, like in temple, or "join temple"
    + template-in, like ... why not just that?
    + short name
    + reflects main point: just template instance with update, nothing else
    + city name
    - templin.js doesn't seem sustainable for long play
      ~ templ-in.js underlines point a bit better
      + templ-in-js is a nice side-meaning
    - a bit artificial, overthinking-like, too "compromisy"
    - templ is too abrupt of template. Either `tpl`, `tmpl`
  * template-in.js?
    + phrasal verb, "enable template", like tune-in
    + template-instantiate
    + complete valid english phrase
    + reads like "template in js"
    + matches spectjs style naming (element-props, define-element, spect)
    - loses meaning of temple
    - a bit misleading from template instantiation.
  * tmpl-in.js? tmpl-ins.js? tmpl-inst.js? tmplin? tpl-in.js? tpl-ins.js? tplins.js? tpl-ins.js?
    + abbreviated but complete meaning
    + better than tpl-in.js
    + can be validly read as temple-in-js
    + tmpl is valid abbreviation
    + minimally possible name
    - hard to guess, doesn't look reliable
    - sounds like "ta plin"
    + seems to be what God would like, good balance
  * temp-in.js, tempin.js?
    . temp-in.js
    - no much reference to template
    - no much reference to temple
    - reference to tempo, temperature
  * temin.js
    + min meaning
    - temin has no point
  * templx.js ?
    - no reference to instantiation
  * templins.js, templ-ins.js?
    + plural adds repeating action association
    + same + as templ-in
    + more apparent template instantiation meaning
    - templins.js - very misleading.
      ~ templ-ins.js is not as much
  * templ.in.js ?

    - extra suffix sucks
